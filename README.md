Paper Abstract
This research conducts an in-depth comparison of clustering algorithms for identifying price clusters in financial time series across various currency markets. It includes a detailed empirical evaluation against stochastic benchmarks to analyze the effectiveness of the algorithms and offers insights into their performance across different currencies. Ward Hierarchical clustering is highlighted for its superior capability in identifying key price levels.
